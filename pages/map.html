<div ng-controller="TestCtrl">
  Hello, I am coming from public/pages/map.html<br><br>

  Please type: command option I<br>

  You should see the console pop up on the right side of your screen ----><br>

  Let Cbelle know what it says.<br><br>

  Now, on to how this page came to be:<br>
  1. all the page routing is done in the controllers folder.<br><br>
  2. inside controllers folder, the document is set up to be an angular "module"<br><br>
    - a module is like a special portion of entire app specialized for a unique function,
      ... but Cbelle was too lazy to make many modules, so Cbelle made entire document a module.
  <br><br>3. Looking at index.html, the "ng-view" key word allows html pages to switch in and out
      of that element's inner html. Switching is activated upon user interaction and the 
      routing that was set up in controllers folder.
<br><br>
  .... and that's how I came to be.
